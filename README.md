# Project Geospatial:
### Author: Joan Roca Jovani

## Introduction
We were given the task to find the most optimal place to place a videogame company given some requisites:
- Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
- 30% of the company staff have at least 1 child.
- Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
- Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.
- Account managers need to travel a lot.
Everyone in the company is between 25 and 40, give them some place to go party.
- The CEO is vegan.
- If you want to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km.
- The office dogâ€”"Dobby" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.

### Choosing the first parameters

Given all these, I decided the three most important aspects were:
- **Close to gaming companies**.
- **Close to companies with funding**.
- **Close to design companies**.

  
### Choosing the countries

From the companies database I got 3 filtered tables with the previous requisites. Then, I wanted to find the countries with most of them.

USA was first in all categories, UK was second and Canada 3rd in 2 categories. So I picked those..

### Choosing the cities

From there I wanted to pick one city for each of the countries. Since the US had much more companies than any other country, I analyzed the US cities separatedly.

NY and San Francisco were 1st and 2nd in all 3 categories but I chose NY because the city had more design companies. For the rest of the countries I chose London, which was first in all categories, and Toronto, which was the Canadian city with most companies in 2 out of 3 categories.

Next, I joined the 3 tables for each city and plotted all the companies on a map. Then, I chose a location that satisfied the 3 requisites at best.

**New York:**

**Toronto:**

**London:**

Afterwards, using the Foursquare API I calculated the distances to all demanded venues except the dog hairdresser because being something that is not important on a day-to-day basis. The table that I got is the following.

**Insert Table**

Finally I gave the following wheights to the importance of the venue:
- Basketball Court: 5%
- Starbucks: 20%
- Vegan Restaurant: 15%
- Airport: 25%
- Nightclub: 15%
- School: 20%

And with the previous weights I created a score ranking the cities from best to worst.

Finally, NY has the best score, and it also is the city with most design, gaming and financed companies. So the location of the company would be NYC.
